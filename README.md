# Assignment 3 - NumPy
this assignment is about slicing and plotting.

## Create jupyter notebook with 4 data illustrations

1. First create a file with your python module. This is where you should put your functions to be used in the notebook.
2. Second create a function to read the csv file containing Copenhagen city population data and return a numpy array (numpy.ndarray). **hint:** use `np.genfromtxt(filename, delimiter=',', dtype=np.uint, skip_header=1)` as in the slides
3. Third create a function that can extract the number of all the citizens from native english speaking countries and from non english speaking countries. How many are there of each? (**hint** remember that with python you can return multiple values from a function).
4. Now create another function that can take 2 arguments: 
  - 1: the dataset in the form of a 2dimensional data array where y=data rows and x=[year, area, age nationality, amount].
  - 2: the mask in the form: data[:,3] == 5120 to find swedish or data[:,0] == 1999 to filter on year
  - the return value must be the filtered dataset.
5. Create another function that can take 2 arguments:
  - a dataset with same characteristics as above and
  - a value for the x-axis (either year, area, age or nationality)
  - return value should be the accumulated population for all x-values.
  - **hint:** if year is chosen for x then y is all accumulated amounts from all areas, ages and nationalities.
6. Create Illustration 1: In your notebook use the above function and create a 2d array of year as x and accumulated amount as y:
  - create a line graph of the population change over time for all of Copenhagen
7. Create illustration 2: In your notebook use your module to create a dataset where development of all German citizens can be shown over time
8. Create illustration 3: Show a bar plot of all the 18-25 year old in the different areas of copenhagen and in the same plot show (in a different color) all 60-67 year old in the different areas.
9. Create illustration 4: show a pie chart of age groups (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 ...) in Ã˜sterbro part of Copenhagen. create another similar piechart for Vesterbro.
